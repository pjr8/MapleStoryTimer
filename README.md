A simple overlay for Maplestory in order to farm effectively without losing drops.

Overall features:
* Timer counting down for 140s for farming, popup + sound, then 25s for picking up drops
* Move UI by clicking and dragging window
* Resizable UI by mouse scroll wheel


For those looking to change anything (I use IntelliJ), I used Gradle with Launch4j and ShadowJar. If you want to create just the jar, run task shadow/shadowJar. If you want the executable + jar, run task launch4j/createExe.
